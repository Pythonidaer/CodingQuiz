     What I want to do next:
     Start button has timer go down from 75 seconds but stays on page
     
     Home page has View Highscores in left corner and Time: 0 in right corner
     Start button needs to stay on this page

     Start button shows first question
     Clicking answer (1-4) switches to next question
     If answer is right or wrong, a grey 'Correct!' or 'Wrong!' shows at the bottom under a <hr>

     When last question (or time runs out) is answered:

     "All done!"

     Your final score is: ___ Submit

     Submit goes to:

     "Highscores" (highscores.html - a different page!)
     two buttons:
     - Go Back (to index.html)
     - Clear Highscores (clears scoreboard, otherwise users localScores should remain)
